Description: A professional-grade, multi-sectoral platform designed for 
    sub-national monitoring of global development indicators. Optimized 
    for large-scale household surveys including DHS, MICS, MIS, IHBS, 
    SPA, and LSMS, the package provides a comprehensive workflow covering 
    Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, and Prescriptive analytics. Key 
    functionalities include a 'Spatial Equalizer' for seamless data 
    integration, 17 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods, 
    Small Area Estimation (SAE) via Fay-Herriot models, Spatial 
    Econometrics (SAR/SEM), and 4-stage hierarchical multilevel modeling 
    using the 'glmmTMB' engine. It enables researchers and policymakers 
    to identify geographic hotspots, quantify spatial inequality (SDG 10), 
    and generate publication-ready reports.

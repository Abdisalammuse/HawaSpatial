### Health & Areal Weighted Analysis (HAWA) Platform
**Developed by: Abdisalam Hassan Muse (PhD)**  
**Affiliation: Amoud University / Global Development Intelligence**

---

## Overview

**HawaSpatial Pro** is a professional-grade, multi-sectoral R package designed to bridge the gap between complex Bayesian spatial modeling and actionable policy insights. It provides a robust framework for sub-national monitoring of development indicators, specifically optimized for large-scale household surveys such as **DHS (USAID)**, **MICS (UNICEF)**, and **IHBS (World Bank)**.

The platform is engineered to support the monitoring of the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** by identifying geographic "Hot Spots" and "Cold Spots" through advanced computational statistics.

## Key Features

*   **16 ESDA Methods:** Including Global/Local Moran's I, LISA Cluster Maps, Getis-Ord Gi*, and EBS Smoothing.
*   **Bivariate Spatial Analysis:** Visualize the relationship between two indicators (e.g., Wealth vs. Health) using 3x3 color grids.
*   **Advanced Geostatistics:** Ordinary Kriging for surface interpolation and Spatial Lag Model (SAR) residuals.
*   **Bayesian Multilevel Modeling:** 4-Stage modeling (Null, Individual, Community, and Full) using **INLA** (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations).
*   **Bayesian Spatial Random Effects:** Map unexplained cluster-level variation aggregated to regional levels.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Export publication-ready reports in Word, PDF, or HTML.

## Installation

You can install the development version of HawaSpatial from [GitHub](https://github.com/Abdisalammuse/HawaSpatial) with:

```r
# Install remotes if not already installed
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

# Install INLA (Required dependency not on CRAN)
install.packages("INLA", repos = c(getOption("repos"), INLA = "https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep = TRUE)

# Install HawaSpatial Pro
remotes::install_github("Abdisalammuse/HawaSpatial")

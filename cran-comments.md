## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have fixed the following:
* Fixed the duplicate entry of 'rmarkdown' which appeared in both Imports and Suggests.
* Put the word 'sectoral' in single quotes in the Description to satisfy the spellchecker.
* Verified that all global variables are correctly handled.

## Test results
Passed R CMD check on Windows 10 (R 4.5.0) with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 notes (locally).

## Notes
* The word 'sectoral' is a standard technical term in global development and policy analysis.

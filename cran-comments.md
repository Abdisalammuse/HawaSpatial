## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. I have fixed the following:
* Added a vignette to exercise the package code (fixing the Warning).
* Put acronyms in single quotes in the Description (fixing spelling Notes).
* Added missing global variables to utils_globals.R.

## Test results
Passed R CMD check on Windows 10 (R 4.5.0) with 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 1 note.

## Notes
* The note regarding 'no visible global function definition' for 'golem_add_external_resources' is a known golem behavior for internal resource management.
* Acronyms like 'DHS', 'MICS', 'SAE' are standard in the field of Global Development.
